= Documentation =
== Usage ==
Vuser has a built in help system that can be viewed with the _help_ keyword.
{{{
vuser help
vuser help extension_name
}}}

== Manuals ==
Vuser, vsoapd and most of the extensions include documentation in the perldoc for the extension. On some systems, you can use `man` instead of `perldoc`.

*Examples:*
{{{
perldoc vuser
perldoc vsoapd
perldoc VUser::Google::Apps
}}}

*Note:* On debian-based systems, you may have to install the `perl-doc` package.
{{{
apt-get install perl-doc
}}}

The _man_ keyword will return the manual for the extension.

*Examples:*
{{{
vuser man Email
vuser man Google::Apps
}}}

== Wiki ==
The [http://code.google.com/p/vuser/w/list wiki] has additional documentation and tips for using and extending vuser.
