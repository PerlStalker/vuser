This project is a reworking of PerlStalker's excellent vuser script
which can be found here: http://perlstalker.amigo.net/courier/

The goal of this project is to simplify the system administration tasks
of maintaining multiple virtual mail domains using the courier-mta mail
server (http://courier-mta.org) where the account information is stored
in a mysql database

Documentation for vuser can be viewed by typing pod2text vuser

before vuser will work, you must copy vuser.conf.dist to vuser.conf and
edit it to match your setup.

WARNING!
Since this reworking has not been tested much, it should currently be
considered beta!!

We can usually be found in #courier on irc.freenode.net
