VUser-Barracuda is an extension to vuser to mange the Barracuda Spam Firewall
from Barracuda Networks. This extension works through the API documented at
http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/downloads/barracuda_API_v3.pdf.

TODO

The following is a list of things that need to be done.

* Add support for adding users
* Fix list_users and list for config_get.cgi
* Generalize XML parsing. This would probably help fix list_users and list.
