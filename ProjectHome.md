Vuser is an application designed to ease the work for system administrators. It's primary function is to aggregate the various tasks that go into adding users, web sites, whatever into a single command.

Vuser can be run as simple shell command or can be used in batch mode or via its SOAP daemon, vsoapd, to make running commands on remote systems much easier.

A well defined extension system makes adding new features a simple matter. New extensions can use keywords and actions from other extensions allowing an admin to add tasks to only those things that need to be extended.
