# Google Code #

New releases will be available from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/vuser/downloads/list).

# CPAN #

It's usually easier to install the packages from CPAN.

```
perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install <module name>
```

Use `VUser::CORE` to as the module name to install vuser and `VUser::SOAP` to install vsoapd.

This will also fetch any dependencies that are missing.
